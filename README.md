# flask-income-classification-deployment
<p>The income classification model is done with <b>python (sklearn, pandas, NumPy, and flask) and deployed on Heroku</b>.
<hr>

  In this project, I have built the model which predicts the income of the person or employee either is greater than 50k$ or less than 50K$.
  This income classification model is based on different features like fnlwgt, education, occupation, capital-gain, capital-loss, income, 
  and hours-per-week, etc. so this is a classification problem I used different classification algorithms to solve this problem and select 
  the best performing algorithm. This project is deployed in production I converted this project into a web app so users just need to provide
  the data and model predict the class of that provided data.<p/>
